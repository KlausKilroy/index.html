        Hi, I'm Klaus, and this is my personal page

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <img src="me.jpg" alt="Me" style="width: 300px; height: auto;">
        <p>
            I'm dedicated Cyber Security Analyst with a passion for safeguarding digital
            <br>
            infrastructures and mitigating emerging cyber threats. As a proud graduate of
            <br>
            Emory University, I honed my skills in cybersecurity and developed a strong
            <br>
            foundation in information security principles, maintaining an impressive 98%
            <br>
            grade average. I actively collaborated with classmates in study sessions and
            <br>
            occasionally provided tutoring support.
            <br>
            <br>
            As a transgender male, I navigate my professional and personal life with
            <br>
            resilience. My legal name is Tia Belle Akerman, but I prefer to be known as
            <br>
            Klaus Topher Kilroy until I can make the change official.

        <h2>In my free time...</h2>
        <p>
            I immerse myself in studying Cyber Security, contributing to my GitHub page,
            <br>
            and preparing for the Security+ and Network+ exams. I also enjoy brushing up
            <br>
            on bash scripting and refining my skills in navigating Kali Linux.
